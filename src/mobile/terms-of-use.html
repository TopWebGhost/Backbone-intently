				<p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a legal contract between Intently, Inc. ("Us" or "Our" or "We") and
					You (collectively, "Everyone") and govern Your use of all the text, data, information, graphics,
					photographs and more (all of which We refer to as “Materials”) that We and Our affiliates may make
					available to You, as well as any services and the software (including any browser extension) we make
					available to you to allow you to access the services We may provide through any of Our websites (all
					of such Materials, software and services are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Services”).</p>
				<p>READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES. USING SERVICES INDICATES THAT YOU HAVE BOTH READ AND
					ACCEPT THESE TERMS.  YOU CANNOT USE THE SERVICES IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS.</p>
				<p>NOTE:  THESE TERMS CONTAIN A DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION WAIVER
					THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS AND WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH THE COMPANY.
					YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS PROVIDED BELOW.</p>

				<h4>GENERAL USE</h4>
				<p>We invite You to use the Services for individual, consumer purposes ("Permitted Purposes") – enjoy!</p>
				<p>In these Terms we are granting You a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use
					and to display the Materials; Your right to use the Materials is conditioned on Your compliance with these
					Terms.  You have no other rights in the Services or any Materials and You may not modify, edit, copy,
					reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit any of the
					Services or Materials in any manner.  If You make copies of any of the Services while engaging in Permitted
					Purposes then We ask that You be sure to keep on the copies all of Our copyright and other proprietary
					notices as they appear on the Services.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, if You breach any of these Terms the above license will terminate automatically and You
					must immediately destroy any downloaded or printed Materials (and any copies thereof).</p>

				<h4>BROWSER EXTENSION OR PLUGIN</h4>
				<p>If you wish to install the Intently browser extension or plugin (the “Plugin”) to use as part of the
					Services, then subject to your agreement and compliance with these Terms and the Privacy Policy, We
					hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install and use an
					object code copy of the Plugin  code as part of the Services. This license is solely for your own, private,
					non-commercial purposes in enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Us and
					 in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part
					of our Plugin  or any other software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code
					of the Plugin  or software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.
					If the Plugin  is determined to be illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are situated,
					 you shall not be granted any license to use the Plugin , and must refrain from using it.</p>
				<p>By using the PlugIn, you expressly agree that we can collect information about your browsing activities:
					 including your browsing history – such as the URLs you visit, pages you view, and ads you see; your activities
					 on Intently and within the Services, as well as on third party sites, including information about images
					 you upload or comment on via the Plugin , and certain other publically available information on the pages
					 you view; and your profile and other information related to the social media accounts you connect with
					the Service.  We will use this information to provide the Services to you and as set forth in our Privacy
					Policy.</p>

				<h4>CHANGES</h4>
				<p>We may alter the Materials and Services We offer You and/or choose to modify, suspend or discontinue this
					 Website and/or any of the Services at any time and without notifying You.  We may also change, update,
					 add or remove provisions (collectively, “modifications”) of these Terms from time to time.
					Because Everyone benefits from clarity, We promise to inform You of any modifications to these
					 Terms by posting them on this Website and providing notice within the Service; if You have registered
					with Us, we may also send an email that We will send to the address that You provided during registration.
					 To be sure We properly reach Your email inbox, We just ask that You let Us know if Your preferred email
					address changes at any time after Your registration.</p>
				<p>If You object to any such modifications, Your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Services.
					Continued use of the Services following notice of any such modifications indicates You acknowledge and
					agree to be bound by the modifications. Also, please know that these Terms may be superseded by
					expressly-designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages of the Services.
					 These expressly-designated legal notices or terms are incorporated into these Terms and supersede the
					provision(s) of these Terms that are designated as being superseded.</p>

				<h4>USING THE SERVICES</h4>
				<p>We appreciate You visiting our Website and allow You to do just that – stop by and leisurely check it out
					 without even registering with Us!</p>
				<p>However, in order to access certain password-restricted areas of the Services and to use certain parts of

					<li>Preferred username and password.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You may also provide additional, optional information so that We can provide You a more customized
					experience when using the Services –but, We will leave that decision with You.  Once You submit the
					required registration information, We alone will determine whether or not to approve Your proposed account.
					For so long as You use the account, You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information
					which can be accomplished by logging into Your account and making relevant changes directly or contacting
					Us using the below contact information and We can make the changes for You.  And, if You forget Your
					password – no worries as We will happily send a password update to Your provided email address.</p>
				<p>You are responsible for complying with these Terms when You access the Services, whether directly or through
					any account that You may setup through or on the Services.  Because it is Your account, it is Your job to
					obtain and maintain all equipment and services needed for access to and use of This Services as well as
					paying related charges.  It is also Your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of Your
					password(s), including any password of a third-party site that We may allow You to use to access
					the Services.  Should You believe Your password or security for This Services has been breached in any
					way, You must immediately notify Us.</p>

				<h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
				<p>We respect the information that You provide to Us, and want to be sure You fully understand exactly how We
					use that information.  So, please review Our <a href="#/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”)</a>
					which explains everything.</p>

				<h4>LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES</h4>
				<p>We think links are convenient, and We sometimes provide links on the Services to third-party websites. We
					are not obligated to review any third-party websites that You link to from the Services, We do not control
					any of the third-party websites, and We are not responsible for any of the third-party websites (or the
					products, services, or content available through any of them). Thus, We do not endorse or make any
					representations about such third-party websites, any information, software, products, services, or materials
					 found there or any results that may be obtained from using them. If You decide to access any of the third-party
					 websites linked to from the Services, You do this entirely at Your own risk and You must follow the
					privacy policies and terms and conditions for those third-party websites. Certain areas of the Services
					may allow You to interact and/or conduct transactions with one or more third-party websites, and, if
					applicable, allow you to configure your privacy settings in that third-party website account to permit
					Your activities on the Services to be shared with Your contacts in your third-party site account.</p>

				<h4>SUBMISSIONS</h4>
				<p>Certain parts of the Services permit You to submit feedback, information, data, text, software,
					messages, or other materials (each, a "User Submission").  You agree that You are solely responsible
					for all of Your User Submissions and that any such User Submission is considered both non-confidential
					and non-proprietary.  Further, We do not guarantee that You will be able to edit or delete any User
					Submission You have submitted.</p>
				<p>By submitting any User Submission, You are promising Us that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You own all rights in Your User Submissions (including, without limitation, all rights to the reproduction

						intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or any other legal or moral rights of any third party;</li>

					<li>Any information contained in Your User Submission is not known by You to be false, inaccurate,

					<li>Your User Submission is not, and may not reasonably be considered to be, defamatory, libelous,
						hateful, racially, ethnically, religiously, or otherwise biased or offensive, unlawfully threatening,
						or unlawfully harassing to any individual, partnership, or corporation, vulgar, pornographic, obscene,
						 or invasive of another's privacy;</li>
					<li>You were not and will not be compensated or granted any consideration by any third party for
						submitting Your User Submission;</li>
					<li>Your User Submission does not incorporate materials from a third-party website, or addresses,

						damaging programs or files;</li>
					<li>Your User Submission does not contain any information that You consider confidential, proprietary,
						or personal; and</li>
					<li>Your User Submission does not contain or constitute any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising,
						promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of
						solicitation.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>By submitting a User Submission, You grant to Us an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, non-exclusive,
					fully-paid, worldwide, royalty-free license (sublicensable through multiple tiers) to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly
						display Your User Submissions (or any modification thereto), in whole or in part, in any format
						or medium now known or later developed;</li>
					<li>Use (and permit others to use) Your User Submission in any manner and for any purpose (including,
						 without limitation, commercial purposes) that We deem appropriate in Our sole discretion (including,
						 without limitation, to incorporate Your User Submission or any modification thereto, in whole or
						 in part, into any technology, product, or service);</li>
					<li>Display advertisements in connection with Your User Submissions and to use Your User Submissions
						for advertising and promotional purposes.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>We may, but are not obligated to, pre-screen User Submissions or monitor any area of the Services through
					which User Submissions may be submitted. We are not required to host, display, or distribute any User
					Submissions on or through the Services and may remove at any time or refuse any User Submissions for
					 any reason. We are not responsible for any loss, theft, or damage of any kind to any User Submissions.
					Further, You agree that We may freely disclose Your User Submission to any third party absent any
					obligation of confidence on the part of the recipient.</p>

				<h4>UNAUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES</h4>
				<p>To be clear, We authorize Your use of the Services only for Permitted Purposes.  Any other use of the
					Services beyond the Permitted Purposes is prohibited and, therefore, constitutes unauthorized use of
					the Services.  This is because as between You and Us, all rights in the Services remain Our property.</p>
				<p>Unauthorized use of the Services may result in violation of various United States and international copyright
					laws.  Because We prefer keeping this relationship drama-free, We want to give You examples of things to avoid.

						 or any other means.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You agree to hire attorneys to defend Us if You violate these Terms and that violation results in a
					problem for Us.  You also agree to pay any damages that We may end up having to pay as a result of
					Your violation.  You alone are responsible for any violation of these Terms by You.  We reserve the
					right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification
					by You and, in such case, You agree to cooperate with Our defense of such claim.</p>

				<h4>PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h4>
				<p>"Intently" is a trademark that belongs to Us.  Other trademarks, names and logos on the Services are the
					property of their respective owners.</p>

					 are Our sole property,  Copyright © April 22, 2015. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
					  Except as otherwise required or limited by applicable law, any reproduction, distribution, modification,
					retransmission, or publication of any copyrighted material is strictly prohibited without the express
					written consent of the copyright owner or license.</p>

				<h4>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT</h4>
				<p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and encourage You to do the same. Accordingly,
					We have a policy of removing User Submissions that violate intellectual property rights of others,
					suspending access to the Services (or any portion thereof) to any user who uses the Services in
					violation of someone’s intellectual property rights, and/or terminating in appropriate circumstances
					the account of any user who uses the the Services in violation of someone’s intellectual property rights.</p>
				<p>Pursuant to Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512 (The Digital Millennium Copyright Act or “DMCA”),
					 We have implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed copyright infringement and for
					processing such claims in accordance with such law. If You believe Your copyright or other intellectual
					property right is being infringed by a user of the Services, please provide written notice to Our Agent
					for notice of claims of infringement:</p>

				<p>Attn: ____ DMCA Agent</p>

				<p>To be sure the matter is handled immediately, Your written notice must:</p>
				<ul>

					<li>Identify the allegedly infringing material in a sufficiently precise manner to allow Us to
						locate that material;</li>
					<li>Contain adequate information by which We can contact You (including postal address,

					unable to address the listed concern.</p>

				<h5>Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification</h5>
				<p>We will notify You that We have removed or disabled access to copyright-protected material that You
					provided, if such removal is pursuant to a validly received DMCA take-down notice. In response,
					You may provide Our Agent with a written counter-notification that includes the following information:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
					<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and
						the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
					<li>A statement from You under the penalty of perjury, that You have a good faith belief that the material
						was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed
						or disabled; and</li>
					<li>Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that You consent to the
						jurisdiction of a court for the judicial district in which Your physical address is located,
						or if Your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in

						notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person.</li>
				</ol>

				<h5>Termination of Repeat Infringers</h5>
				<p>We reserve the right, in Our sole discretion, to terminate the account or access of any user of the Services
					or Service who is the subject of repeated DMCA or other infringement notifications.</p>

				<h4>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</h4>
				<p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
					PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES ARE WITH YOU.</p>
				<p>WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY) WITH RESPECT TO THE
					SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
					FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>
				<p>THIS MEANS THAT WE DO NOT PROMISE YOU THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF PROBLEMS.  Without limiting the generality
					 of the foregoing, We make no warranty that the Services will meet Your requirements or that the Services
					will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free or that defects in the Services will be corrected.
					 We make no warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services or as to the
					accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the Services. No advice or information,
					whether oral or written, obtained by You through the Services or from Us or Our subsidiaries/other
					affiliated companies shall create any warranty. We disclaim all equitable indemnities.</p>

				<h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
				<p>WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR DISPLAYING, COPYING, OR DOWNLOADING
					ANY MATERIALS TO OR FROM THE SERVICES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT,
					EXTRAORDINARY, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS
					OF DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE) HOWEVER ARISING, EVEN IF WE KNOW THERE
					IS A POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

				<h4>LOCAL LAWS; EXPORT CONTROL</h4>
				<p>We control and operate the Services from Our headquarters in the United States of America and the
					entirety of the Services may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations.  If You use
					 the Services outside the United States of America, You are solely responsible for following applicable
					 local laws. If the Services or any part thereof is determined to be illegal under the laws of the
					jurisdiction in which you are situated, you shall not be granted any right to use the Services, and
					must refrain from using them.</p>

				<h4>FEEDBACK</h4>
				<p>Any submissions by You to Us (e.g., comments, questions, suggestions, materials – collectively,
					“Feedback”) through any communication whatsoever (e.g., call, fax, email) will be treated as both
					non-confidential and non-proprietary.  You hereby assign all right, title, and interest in, and We
					are free to use, without any attribution or compensation to You, any ideas, know-how, concepts,
					techniques, or other intellectual property and proprietary rights contained in the Feedback, whether
					or not patentable, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing,
					having manufactured, licensing, marketing, and selling, directly or indirectly, products and services
					using such Feedback.  You understand and agree that We are not obligated to use, display, reproduce,
					or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts, or techniques contained in the Feedback, and You have
					no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution.</p>

				<h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</h4>
				<p class="strong">Please Read This Provision Carefully.  It Affects Your Legal Rights.</p>
				<p>This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy,
					 whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort – including, but not limited to, fraud,
					 misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence – or any other legal or equitable theory, and
					includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability
					 of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between You and Us.  Effectively, then, “dispute”
					 is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating
					to services or products provided or billed to You (such as Our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party
					vendors) whenever You also assert claims against Us in the same proceeding.</p>
				<p>This Provision provides that all disputes between You and Us shall be resolved by binding arbitration
					because acceptance of These Terms constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigation claims and all
					opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  We prefer this because We believe arbitration is less
					drama-filled than litigation.  To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review
					of an arbitration award is limited.  The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same
					damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).  You may, however, opt-out of this Provision
					which means You would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury,
					and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited
					to, class actions).  EVERYONE AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE,
					WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED
					EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>
				<h5>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h5>
				<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, You must first give Us an opportunity to resolve
					 the Dispute which is first done by [emailing] to Us at support@intently.com the following information:
					 (1)Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of Your Claim, and (4) A description of the
					specific relief You seek. If We do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving Your
					notification, than You may pursue Your Dispute in arbitration.  You may pursue Your dispute in a court
					only under the circumstances described below.</p>
				<h5>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h5>
				<p>Notwithstanding the above, Your or We may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration
					if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION
					 PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).
					  You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing Us at support@intently.com the following information:
					(1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Us
					through arbitration. Either way, We will not take any decision You make personally.  In fact, We promise
					 that Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on Your
					relationship with Us.  But, We do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that any opt-out
					request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your dispute in arbitration
					 or small claims court.</p>
				<h5>Arbitration Procedures</h5>
				<p>If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution)
					 either You or We may initiate arbitration proceedings.  The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),
					www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted
					before a single arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall
					in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.  All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide,
					including the scope of this Provision.</p>
				<p>For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
					Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration
					 Rules will apply.  In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall
					 apply.  The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  For arbitration before
					JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery
					Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.  The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or
					by calling 1-800-352-5267.  This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration
					 rules.  Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
				<p>Because the Services and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)
					governs the arbitrability of all disputes.  However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive
					law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>
				<p><span class="strong">Arbitration Award</span> – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief
					that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against
					or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award
					in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.  Such award will be
					final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered
					in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
				<p><span class="strong">Location of Arbitration</span> – You or We may initiate arbitration in either New York
					or the federal judicial district that includes Your billing address.  In the event that You select the
					latter, We may transfer the arbitration to New York so long as We agree to pay any additional fees or
					costs which the arbitrator determines You incur as a result of the transfer.</p>
				<p><span class="strong">Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</span> – So long as You place a request in writing
					prior to commencement of the arbitration, We will pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses.
					But, You will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration
					which include but are not limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses.  In addition to any fees and
					costs recoverable under applicable law, if You provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Us as
					provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that
					You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s
					fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
				<h5>Class Action Waiver</h5>
				<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
					claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims
					(such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both You and
					We specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.  If You choose to pursue Your
					Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver
					will not apply to You.  Neither You, nor any other user of the Services can be a class representative,
					class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without
					having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>
				<h5>Jury Waiver</h5>
				<p>You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision in these Terms, You and We are each waiving the
					right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.  In the absence of this Provision, You
					 and We might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or
					jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
					  Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.  Other rights that You would have if You
					went to court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and  certain types of discovery) may be more limited or
					may also be waived.</p>
				<h5>Severability</h5>
				<p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal
					 or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force
					 and effect.  If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire
					Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
				<h5>Continuation</h5>
				<p>This Provision shall survive the termination of Your account with Us or Our affiliates and Your
					discontinued use of the Services.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
					We agree that if We make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), You
					may reject any such change and require Us to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute
					between Us arises.</p>

				<h4>GENERAL</h4>
				<p>We think direct communication resolves most issues – if We feel that You are not complying with these
					Terms, We will tell You.  We will even provide You with recommended necessary corrective action(s)
					because We value this relationship.</p>
				<p>However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Us, may require immediate termination of
					Your access to the Services without prior notice to You.  The Federal Arbitration Act, California state
					law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will
					govern these Terms.  Foreign laws do not apply.  Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described
					above, any disputes relating to these Terms or the Services will be heard in the courts located in San
					Diego County, California.  If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then
					such term(s) shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will
					be modified.  By choosing not to enforced any of these Terms, We are not waiving Our rights.  These
					Terms are the entire agreement between You and Us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous
					negotiations, discussions or agreements between Everyone about the Services.  The proprietary rights,
					disclaimer of warranties, representations made by You, indemnities, limitations of liability and general
					provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
