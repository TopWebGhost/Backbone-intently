						preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>How We Share Your Information</h4>
				<p>We may share your information, including personal information, as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="strong">Affiliates.</span> We may disclose the information we collect from you to our
						affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your personally
						identifiable information will be subject to this Policy.</li>
					<li><span class="strong">Third Parties.</span> We may also share your information with certain third party

				<h4>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h4>
				<p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about
					your use of our Site or services. We may combine this information with other personal information we
					collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).</p>
				<p>Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain
					tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).   If you use our Plugin , you are
					agreeing that we can gather certain information about the third party sites you visit, as explained above.</p>
				<p><span class="strong">Cookies.</span> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s
					hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for
					you to navigate our Site and services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow
					us to track your activities at our Site and Service.</p>
				<p><span class="strong">Disabling Cookies.</span> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you
					prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar
					on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the
					browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our
					Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>
				<p><span class="strong">Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</span> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics
					with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored
					on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs
					(also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things,
					 track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about Site usage.
					We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track
					email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
				<p><span class="strong">Third-party Analytics.</span> We use third party analytics tools, including Google
					Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze this information in order to improve functionality and
					user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors' needs. Accordingly, usage data
					is shared with Google, which has its own privacy policy addressing how it uses such information. We
					encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.</p>

				<h4>User Generated Content</h4>
				<p>We invite you to post content to the Services. If you post content, your content may become public and
					Intently cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the
					law, or your personal privacy.</p>

				<h4>Third-Party Links</h4>
				<p>Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked
					websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third
					party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>

				<h4>Security of My Personal Information</h4>
				<p>We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized
					access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data
					security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized
					access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared
					computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in
					and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any
					activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

				<h4>Access To My Personal Information</h4>
				<p>You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your
					profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted
					may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site for a period of time, and we may maintain
					copies of such information in our business records.</p>

				<h4>What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?</h4>
				<p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications
					by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10
					 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about
					recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails
					about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.</p>

				<h4>Children Under 13</h4>
				<p>Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided
					us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.</p>

				<p>California residents may request a list of certain third parties to which we have disclosed personally
					identifiable information about you for their own direct marketing purposes. You may make one request per
					 calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a
					 current California address for your response. You may request this information in writing by contacting

					to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on our
					 Site, at www.intently.com/policy. If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our
